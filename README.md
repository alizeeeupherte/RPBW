# RPBW


The RPBW agency was chosen to realize the new ENSA Cachan school of 688890 square feet in Paris Saclay.

- Be responsible: 
He wants the schedule to be respected, followed the construction site. He managed also the financial aspect. Here is a public project and so the image of RPBW is under his responsibility.

In my opinion, the time line remains the most important point to manage. So "Tractations" play a vital role. They concern all the decision regarding  problems or solutions on site (this goes from the execution drawings discussed between actors, the problems of responsibility in case of collapse on site ...
